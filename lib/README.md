# Static Libraries

One of Disarray's dependencies is FNA which itself uses several native libraries for window management, input, image I/O, 3D graphics, and audio/video playback. A comprehensive list of these libraries are:

- SDL2
- FNA3D
- FAudio
- Theorafile

To ensure FNA, and by extension, Disarray, will run correctly, you must copy the .dll for each of these libraries into the root/lib folder (this folder).

Currently, you can find the libraries precompiled here:

See the FNA documentation for additonal details, found here:
